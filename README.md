-PROJECT OVERVIEW-
* In this project I created a REST API using Express. 
* This API provides a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. 
* Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. 
* To make changes to the database, users will be required to log in, so the API will also allow users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account.
